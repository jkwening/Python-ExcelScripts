1. files with multiple sheets into a new Excel file with only one sheet
    - a new column is added that denotes the sheet name it was pulled from
2. multiple Excel file into a new Excel file with only one sheet
    - currently the first sheet of each Excel file is combined
    - working on option for dictating which sheet for each file to combine

Note:   dialog box is used by user to select files to combine and where to save combined file.
        The dialog box may not pop up as the main window, so you may have to
        minimize some windows to find it. Will work on making that the focus.
